# Contributing to `public-sync`

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `public-sync`. I appreciate your support and welcome your contributions to help enhance this package.

## Reporting Issues

If you come across a bug or have a feature request, please don't hesitate to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OllyFN/public-sync). When doing so, please provide detailed information and clear steps to reproduce the problem.

## Pull Requests

I encourage you to submit pull requests for bug fixes, enhancements, or the addition of new features. To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your desired modifications.
4. Write **clear and concise** commit messages.
5. Open a **pull request** with a descriptive title and a detailed explanation of your changes.

Certainly, here's the revised section with a mention of the code style:

## Code Style

Please adhere to the existing code style to maintain consistency with the project. However, it's worth noting that the current code style may not be optimal, and we appreciate any contributions aimed at improving it. If you believe there are opportunities to enhance the code style or refactor the existing code, your efforts in this regard would be highly welcomed.

Additionally, please follow best practices to ensure that your code is maintainable and readable. This will help make the codebase more accessible and collaborative for all contributors.

Your willingness to refactor and improve the code style is greatly appreciated.

## Testing

As of the current state of this repository, the Tests are in a very bad place, I just recently started to learn Jest so running your tests to make sure your code works in this repo is futile, if anyone is interested in writing the tests it would be much appreciated, there are some test files there already but they're my poor attempts which can be deleted.

## Documentation

Keep the README and other documentation up-to-date with your changes to ensure that users have access to accurate and relevant information.
