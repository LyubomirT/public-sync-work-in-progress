## Reporting Issues

If you come across a bug or have a feature request, please don't hesitate to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OllyFN/public-sync). When doing so, please provide detailed information and clear steps to reproduce the problem.

## Pull Requests

I encourage you to submit pull requests for bug fixes, enhancements, or the addition of new features. To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your desired modifications.
4. Write **clear and concise** commit messages.
5. Ensure your code adheres to the existing code style and passes all tests.
6. Open a **pull request** with a descriptive title and a detailed explanation of your changes.

Certainly, here's the revised section with a mention of the code style:

## Code Style

Please adhere to the existing code style to maintain consistency with the project. However, it's worth noting that the current code style may not be optimal, and we appreciate any contributions aimed at improving it. If you believe there are opportunities to enhance the code style or refactor the existing code, your efforts in this regard would be highly welcomed.

Additionally, please follow best practices to ensure that your code is maintainable and readable. This will help make the codebase more accessible and collaborative for all contributors.

Your willingness to refactor and improve the code style is greatly appreciated.

## Testing

If your contribution introduces new features or modifies existing ones, it's crucial to include appropriate tests. However, please note that our current Jest tests and regex detection may not be optimal. I encourage contributors to consider refactoring and improving these aspects. Any assistance in making our tests more robust or enhancing regex detection would be highly appreciated.
