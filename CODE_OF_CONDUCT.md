# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the `public-sync` project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through any of the project's channels must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We do not tolerate harassment of any contributors. Sexual language and imagery, derogatory comments, or personal attacks are strictly prohibited. Contributors violating these rules will be blocked and reported to the project maintainers.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact us.

If violations occur, maintainers may take corrective action. If issues are not rectified after receiving a warning, temporary or permanent bans may be imposed by project maintainers.

This Code of Conduct applies to the `public-sync` project's GitHub repository, mailing lists, blog content, and any other official communication channels used by our project. The Code of Conduct is also applicable to maintainers and contributors in their project-related environments.

Our project is open to everyone, and we welcome contributions from all willing to follow our Code of Conduct.
